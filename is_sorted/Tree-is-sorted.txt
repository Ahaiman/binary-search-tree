Tree-is-sorted:

The function returns "true" if for each node v :
1) The value of the node (v.val) is greater then or equal to all the values ​​of the nodes belong to sub-tree with root v.left.
2) The value of the node (v.val) is less than or equal to all the values ​​of the nodes belong to sub-tree with root v.right.

In any other case, the function returns "false".

Note:
In this implementation, the key and the value of a node are numbers between 0 to 100. You are welcome to change the limits as you wish by using Python's constants in Math library-   math.inf.
